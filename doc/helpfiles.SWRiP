There are two help areas provided with this release:

helpold.are - The help files as they were at shutdown in July.  This is a mostly complete set of help files for the commands, skills, and races in the game. 

cleanhelp.are - This is a cut down help file, which only includes the truly vital help files that you will need.  For those people who want to start their help files fresh, this is for them.

Both files come with the required greeting, credits and swrip help files.
