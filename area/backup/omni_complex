Galactic Control center, to the south is the Reality Control area, along
with the Supreme Being's offices. Up is a one way passage to the Isolation
Room, where misbehaving mortal beings are sent to cool off. To the east is

From this chamber, all major construction projects which take place in the
galaxy are carefully planned and executed.  A terminal for the discourse
of this topic has been carefully mounted in the far wall, and is blinking
for some reason.  The only exit apparent to you is south.

Omnipresent Being's Office Complex~
The air here is thick with the sounds of creation.  The Supreme Beings
do much of their Galactic building in rooms adjoining this one.  In all,
there are four seperate offices accessable from here, along with the
Reality Control center, which is directly above this room.  North leads
back to the hub of the complex.

Xibar's Abode~
This is a very cozy home, with a nice snug window looking out onto
Fornax. Above the wall is a nice prized trophy, the stuffed head of
Czethros.  Below that is a fireplace, which has a fire lit. There are
several items here, including a chest full of personal belonging and a
very large bed, that is inviting.  If you had not known this was real you
would believe it a hologram generated room, perhaps it is.

An Empty House~
The glimmer you saw was a teleporter, a gate.  One that took you to where
no mortal or immortal has ever laid their eyes before. You are inside
total blackness, illuminated only by the dancing sprites of electrons
running  across their roads of platinum and copper.  A gigantic monitor,
composing one entire wall, flickers with information of the universe you
just left.  Opposite of it, with an input/output deck raised beside it, a
simple cot was provided for the watcher. Welcome to the universe.

Darrik's apartment~
The stream of the night
     rides over the sky
  The gleam of the moon
     hits my bloodshot eyes
  I blink only once
     and there He stands
  His eyes shoot out fire,
     my soul's in His hands.
  He smiles His evil smile,
     His eyes brightly glow,
  He throws me on the ground,
     His full intent I know.
  I hear the old beast howl,
     my whole body turns to cold.
  He stabs me with the ancient steel
      And plays that game so old. 
  Death whispers in my ear,
     I see the gates of Hell.
  I remember well that forsaken year
     when I left my soul to sell.
  I closed my eyes
     and saw His throne.
  It was then I knew
     that I was gone.

Sardog's Fishbowl~
The surrounding area is thick with water, clean and bubbling from a small
bit of corral tucked away in a dune of sand at what appears to be the
bottom of a fishbowl. The sand itself shimmers and glistens, containing a
myriad of colors, each twinkling in the dancing light from the surface of
the water.  To the left, a small castle crafted out of ceramic pink and
blue is nestled into the sand.

&cThe Docta's Office&R&W~
Pristine tile floors and white-washed walls reflect any speck of light
entering the room. The large operating table in the middle of the room
lays dormant, its metal frame lightly coated by a clean white sheet.
The overhead lights hum lightly, reflecting beams of glistening light
from the polished metal of new surgical tools.

The dark, damp room is filled with various torture devices.  Several 
manacles are attached to the walls, a rack lies against a blank wall, and
an iron maiden stands near the door. An ewok  lies strapped to a table,
while a blade whooshes back and forth, getting closer and closer to its
chest.

Vequir Shipyards~
Vequir Construction Yards, one of the new yards created after the death of
the Emperor, works mainly for the civilian classes. Large midsize
freighters and fast starfighters are moved out in large numbers to various
sites around the galaxy.  On occasion, a ship can be bought before it
leaves this site.

Vequir Construction Yards~
The construction yards stretch for miles in deep space.  Durasteel
structures support half-built frames and  innards of the hundreds of
ships. Construction droids and maintenance workers cover each ship like a
swarm of insects.

&bGraveyard.&R&W~
Thousands of graves are here, with corresponding bleached white crosses.
Pain and sorrow have no existance in this wasteland; the owner feels no
such thing. The rotting stench of death attacks your senses, making your
stomach turn. As time passes, the Graveyard acquires more and more dead,
rotting souls. Of course, each life that was once living has a story; but
no one cares, and never will. Upon looking out towards the endless void
that the Graveyard is, a strong wind picks up, making you squint your
eyes.  You recall a moment in your life where you lost a loved one, and
tears stream down your cheek..but no pain can be felt.

&rWelcome to Den.&R&W
